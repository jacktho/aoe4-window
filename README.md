# aoe4-window
A tiny utility to simulate windowed borderless mode in Age of Empires IV.

## Notes
1. "Game Window" in AOE4 whould be set to "Windowed"
2. You probably want "Lock Mouse to Window" set to on
3. You'll need version 1 of Autohotkey installed unless you are using the exe available in releases
4. You will need to manually run this every time you start AOE4.

## Usage
1. Start the game and then run the script.
